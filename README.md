Hi, thanks for your interest in the Solana Beach API.
This API has provided users and developers with easy and free access to network data since the early days.
Please check whether this API matches your needs given the current rate limits:
- A general rate limit of 100 requests per 10 seconds. This limit applies to every request.
- An on-demand rate limit of 600 requests per 20 minutes. This limit applies to every request that triggers a call to an external data provider.

If you think we can serve your needs just ask any team member over [Telegram](https://t.me/+UW04VHylcMdlZmUy) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solanabeach_io) for a key and we will respond quickly.

To dive into the API visit the [documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/V2261/solanabeach-backend_api/0.0.1). Important notice: Some endpoints are currently broken and we are working on repairing them.

If you like the API you can support maintenance and further development by delegating to the [Solana Beach Validator](https://solanabeach.io/validator/BeachiopjxQxL7CaHNSZsynApiZCKx9QFVtcWNz3jDBo).
