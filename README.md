Hi, thanks for your interest in the Solana Beach API.
This API has provided users and developers with easy and free access to network data since the early days.
There are currently two rate limits installed:
- A general rate limit of 100 requests per 10 seconds. This limit applies to every request.
- An on-demand rate limit of 600 requests per 20 minutes. This limit applies to every request that triggers a call to an external data provider.

You can apply for a key by contacting any team member over [Telegram](https://t.me/+UW04VHylcMdlZmUy), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solanabeach_io) or [Email](mailto:admin@cryptotech-munich.com).

To dive into the API visit the [documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/V2261/solanabeach-backend_api/0.0.1). Important notice: Some endpoints are currently broken and we are working on repairing them.

You can support this project by delegating to the [Solana Beach Validator](https://solanabeach.io/validator/BeachiopjxQxL7CaHNSZsynApiZCKx9QFVtcWNz3jDBo).
