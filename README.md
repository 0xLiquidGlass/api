# Solana Beach Developer API


At Solana Beach, we are convinced that sharing is caring. We want to help anyone building on Solana to best leverage network data for their projects. Therefore, we are providing limited API access to developers free of charge.
In order to have a structured way of onboarding builders to using our API, we need anyone looking for an API key to follow these simple steps:
1. Fill out this [TypeForm](https://solanabeach.typeform.com/to/FYhRvn21)
2. Sit back and enjoy some time at the â€™Beach until we get back to you
3. Build an awesome product :)
